This project can be deployed using Docker Compose or developed within a DevContainer environment.

## Deployment with Docker Compose

To deploy the application using Docker Compose:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the required environment variables:
    ```env
    BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
    DB_HOST=db
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    DB_USER=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
3. Run the following command to start the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4. Access the application:
    - Admin Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
    - Student Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Development with DevContainer

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. When prompted, reopen the folder in the DevContainer.
4. The container will automatically install dependencies and set up the environment.
